            <p><i>It is a website where you can both have fun and educate yourself</i> as well </p>
            <p>The only way to make children interested in studies is by implementing a method to make
                study more fun and entertaining.<br> The effects of video games on education are widely recognised
            by the world.</p>

                <h2>Why study with games?</h2>
                <p>The use of video games among both youths and elders has been recognised as a remarkable trend and a<br>
                     global success for the video game companies. Although some of these games might be useful in<br> 
                     certain academic areas, the majority of students have been using them from a leisure <br>
                     perspective and consequently became addicted users.<br> In a study, David b. Weldman says</p>

                        However, studies have documented relatively weak relationships <br>
                        between these variables, possibly because hope was measured regarding goals generally,
                         not academic-specific goals.</span>
